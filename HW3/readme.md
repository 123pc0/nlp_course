Open your VM and download the jupyter notebook file and BEST2010 data

Note that this BEST2010 dataset has not been preprocessed, it contains the same content as the one on NECTEC's website.  You might have to move your previous BEST2010 dataset elsewhere. 

```
mv BEST2010 BEST2010-prev
wget --no-check-certificate  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekapolc/nlp_course/master/HW3/thai_skip_gram_homework_for_student.ipynb
wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/ekapolc/nlp_course/raw/master/HW3/BEST2010.zip
unzip BEST2010.zip
```

Submit the completed notebook file on MyCourseVille (4.5 points total, 0.75 points per 1 TODO)

Submit a screenshot of the closed instance (0.5 points)

Note: you do not need a GPU for this. If you install all the necessary python libraries, you can also do the homework on your local machine.
