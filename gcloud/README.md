# BIG REMINDER: Make sure you stop your instances! #
Don't forget to stop your instance when you are done (by clicking on the stop button at the top of the page showing your instances). You can restart your instance and the downloaded software will still be available. 

# BIG REMINDER2: Cleaning up your usage! #
After you are done with your assignments, you should delete the instance, delete the disk (under **Disks** in Compute Engine), and release the static IP.
